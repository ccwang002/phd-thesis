\begin{abstract}
After removing these comments, begin typing the body of your abstract here, double-spaced.  Your
font should be 12-point (which is the text of this sample paragraph). No part of the abstract
should be bolded. If this is for your master's degree, be sure to change all occurrences of the word
``dissertation'' to display as ``thesis,'' and change ``Doctor of Philosophy'' or ``Doctor of
Liberal Arts'' to ``Master of Arts,'' ``Master of Liberal Arts,'' or ``Master of Fine Arts,''
whichever applies.  In the abstract heading above, make sure you use the year your degree is to be
officially earned. Be sure to use your full name as it is recorded in WebSTAC, your dissertation or
thesis advisor's full name(s) wherever appropriate, and the correct title of your degree whenever
referencing it.  The title of your degree will not always be the same as the title of your
department or program, so please check with your departmental administrative assistant and
advisor(s) to be sure you are using the correct degree title.  Please note that an abstract is
required for all dissertation submissions in ProQuest. An abstract is optional for master's thesis
submissions.
