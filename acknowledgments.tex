Cancer genomics has been my dream research and I was so thrilled when I started my rotation in Ding Lab, the lab that I have been reading about in the publications.
Shortly into my rotation, the lab moved into the new McKinley Building (before it's called Couch Biomedical Research Building).
When I joined the first lab meeting there and was shown to the lab cubicles next to the large and beautiful windows, I suddenly had this feeling that \textit{this is it; I am part of the team}.
Today, we are in an exciting time of cancer genomics and our lab is relentlessly pushing the boundaries of the field.
New projects are as cool as ever, while I am now wrapping up mine and passing my desk to the new student.
The lab space shows a bit of wear and tear.
But when it comes to research, I can still can feel the same spark of joy I had the first day I joined the lab.
This feeling will last forever.
I will greatly miss this wonderful place and all the people.

I would like to first thank my PhD advisor, Dr. Li Ding, for her profound vision and great management skills.
Li always has the right insights into new questions and challenges, guiding me to stay on the right track along my graduate study.
Li showed me how to lead a large-scale collaboration, balancing between steering the projects at a high level and navigating through the intricacies of the project at the right times.
Her perseverance and passion motivate me to be a better scientist.
I am grateful for her continued support to pursue what I love in life.

I am indebted to my thesis committee for the constant support and guidance over my research and career development.
I want to thank Dr. Josh Rubin, for his guidance in developing my thesis especially during the most challenging time of my research.
His charisma as a scientist with his passion for glioma research always leaves me feeling excited and motivated.
I am grateful for Dr. Steve Oh's wisdom and humor in our early on imaging meetings that unfortunately did not become part of my thesis, and I truly enjoy his leadership and our discussions about everything.
I would like to thank Dr. Milan Chheda, for his invaluable insights and feedback to my glioblastoma projects as a collaborator. Our virtual meetings would not have been fun and exciting without him. I am also very grateful for Dr. John Edwards's help on my thesis direction and overall guidance that made my thesis complete.
