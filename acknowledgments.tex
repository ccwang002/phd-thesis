Cancer genomics has been my dream research and I was so thrilled when I started my rotation in Ding Lab, the lab that I have been reading about in the publications.
Shortly into my rotation, the lab moved into the new McKinley Building (before it's called Couch Biomedical Research Building). When I joined the first lab meeting there and was shown to the lab cubicles next to the large and beautiful windows, I had this euphoria that \textit{this is it; I am part of the team}.
Today, we are in an exciting time of cancer genomics, restlessly pushing the boundaries of the field to uncover new understanding of cancer.
New projects are cool as ever, while I am now wrapping up mine and passing my desk to the new student.
The lab space shows a bit of wear and tear if I squinted hard.
But when it comes to research, I can still can feel the same spark of joy I had the first day I joined the lab.
Such feeling will last forever.
I will greatly miss this wonderful place and all the people.
