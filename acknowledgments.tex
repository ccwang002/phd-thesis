An acknowledgments page must be included in your final dissertation or thesis.  If you wish to
include a special dedication you can either use it to close the acknowledgments page or place it on
the page that immediately follows.  The acknowledgments page should be listed in the table of
contents.  Place it after the final list used in the document, and before any dedication, abstract,
or epigraph that is included.

It is appropriate to acknowledge sources of academic and financial support; some fellowships and
grants require acknowledgment.

We offer special thanks to the Washington University School of Engineering for allowing us to use
their dissertation and thesis template as a starting point for the development of this document.
