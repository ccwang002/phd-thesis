\section{Summary}
Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most aggressive nervous system cancer. Understanding its molecular pathogenesis is crucial to improving diagnosis and treatment. Integrated analysis of genomic, proteomic, post-translational modification and metabolomic data on 99 treatment-naive GBMs provides insights to GBM biology. We identify key phosphorylation events (e.g., phosphorylated PTPN11 and PLCG1) as potential switches mediating oncogenic pathway activation, as well as potential targets for \gene{EGFR}-, \gene{TP53}-, and RB1-altered tumors. Immune subtypes with distinct immune cell types are discovered using bulk omics methodologies, validated by snRNA-seq, and correlated with specific expression and histone acetylation patterns. Histone H2B acetylation in classical-like and immune-low GBM is driven largely by BRDs, CREBBP, and EP300. Integrated metabolomic and proteomic data identify specific lipid distributions across subtypes and distinct global metabolic changes in \gene{IDH}-mutated tumors. This work highlights biological relationships that could contribute to stratification of GBM patients for more effective treatment.


\section{Introduction}
Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most common primary malignant brain tumor, with roughly 12,000 new cases annually in the United States and median survival under 2 years \cite{delgado-lopezpd_corrales-garciaem:SurvivalGlioblastoma2016,ostromqt_barnholtz-sloanjs:CBTRUSStatistical2019}. The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) \cite{brennancw_chinl:GBM2013,tcga_network:GBM2008} and other studies \cite{yanh_bignerdd:IDH1IDH22009} have reshaped the World Health Organization classification of nervous system tumors \cite{louisdn_ellisondw:2016World2016} to include molecular features \cite{bratdj_wellerm:CIMPACTNOWUpdate2018, louisdn_vondeimlinga:AnnouncingCIMPACTNOW2017}.
GBM is categorized as either \gene{IDH}-wild type (\gene{IDH}-WT; \textasciitilde90\%) or \gene{IDH}-mutant (\textasciitilde10\%). \gene{IDH}-WT GBMs fall into three distinct subclasses (proneural, classical, and mesenchymal) based on genomic alterations and gene expression signatures \cite{verhaakrgw_hayesdn:IntegratedGenomic2010,wangq_verhaakrgw:TumorEvolution2017}. Methylome-based classification is being used to differentially diagnose brain tumors \cite{karimis_zadehg:CentralNervous2019,nassirif_aldapekd:DNAMethylation2019} and may become clinically useful for GBM.
Surgical resection, chemotherapy, and radiotherapy remain the standard of care \cite{stuppr_mirimanoffro:RadiotherapyConcomitant2005,perryjr_trialinvestigators:ShortCourseRadiation2017}, with the recent addition of tumor treating fields \cite{stuppr_ramz:EffectTumorTreating2017}.
Promising immunotherapies have been proposed, including immune checkpoint inhibitors, vaccines, chimeric antigen receptor T cell (CAR-T) therapy, and viral therapy, though none have cleared Phase III trials \cite{limm_wellerm:CurrentState2018,mcgranahant_nagpals:CurrentState2019}.
Despite different subtypes, no specific treatment works more effectively in a pre-specified subset of patients based on transcriptomics, though those with MGMT promoter methylation respond better to temozolomide \cite{stuppr_mirimanoffro:RadiotherapyConcomitant2005}.

Here, we integrated proteogenomic and metabolomic data from 10 platforms including whole genome sequencing (WGS), whole exome sequencing (WES), RNA sequencing (RNA-seq), microRNA-seq (miRNA-seq), single nuclei RNA-seq (snRNA-seq), DNA methylation arrays, proteome, phosphoproteome, acetylome, lipidome, and metabolome to investigate 99 treatment-naive GBMs prospectively collected by the Clinical Proteomic Tumor Analysis Consortium (CPTAC). We report new immune-based subtypes, activation of DNA repair pathways via upregulated phosphosite levels of DNA repair genes in \gene{TP53}-mutated tumors, an apparent phospho-signaling bottleneck in receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK)-altered tumors, and enrichment of histone H2B acetylation and low macrophage content in classical-like GBM tumors. We used single-cell data to investigate contributions of various cell types to bulk tumor signatures and analyzed the mesenchymal subtype to discern epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) signatures in tumor and infiltrating immune cells. The data presented here furnish a resource for future GBM studies.


\section{Results}

\subsection{Proteogenomic and metabolomic features delineate molecular subtypes of glioblastoma}
We characterized the proteogenomic landscape of 99 GBMs and 10 unmatched GTEx normal brain samples. This cohort has diverse origins and clinical characteristics typical of adult GBM. Six cases harbored \gene{IDH1} R132H mutations and had earlier disease onset than those with \gene{IDH1}-WT (median 47 vs. 59 years, t test p = 0.055). We detected one additional non-hotspot \gene{IDH1} mutation (R222C).

All samples were homogenized and aliquoted for each of the ten different omics assays (\fref{fig:gbm-overview-data-avail}, \ref{fig:gbm-proteomic-qc-exp-design}--\subcaptionref{fig:gbm-proteomic-qc-corr}). Mass spectrometry (MS) quantified protein, phosphorylation and acetylation, as previously described \cite{douy_zhaog:CPTACUCEC2020,mertinsp_ncicptac:CPTACBreastCancer2016} (\fref{fig:gbm-proteomic-qc-exp-design}--\subcaptionref{fig:gbm-proteomic-qc-corr}). Metabolome and lipidome levels were respectively measured by label-free gas and liquid chromatography coupled to MS. Genomic properties of our cohort were comparable to those of TCGA GBM cohort \cite{brennancw_chinl:GBM2013} (\fref{fig:gbm-overview-mut-landscape}). We identified many structural variants (SV) in oncogenes, including \gene{EGFR} and \gene{PDGFRA}, and tumor suppressors \gene{PTEN} and \gene{NF1}. \gene{EGFR} mutations often co-occurred with \gene{EGFR} SV and amplification events (p < 0.01). WES and WGS identified \gene{TERT} promoter (\gene{TERT}p) mutations with variant allele frequency (VAF) >5\% (\fref{fig:gbm-overview-mut-landscape}). Copy number analysis identified common focal and arm-level copy number variations (CNVs) (\fref{fig:gbm-subtype-gistic}).

The GBM tumors and GTEx normal tissues were analyzed in 11 TMT 11-plex experiments, each with 10 study samples and a common internal reference sample created by pooling all study samples (equal contribution). The TMT11-labeled samples were then fractionated, split (with 5\% peptide mass analyzed directly for global proteome), and subjected to tandem enrichment of phosphopeptides and acetylated peptides. Peptides were detected and quantified using information from the TMT-11 MS/MS spectra.

We added protein and phosphosite abundance to prior clustering studies of gene expression (\fref{fig:gbm-overview-multi-omics}, \ref{fig:gbm-subtype}). While our results are concordant with TCGA expression-based classification \cite{wangq_verhaakrgw:TumorEvolution2017}, 27 tumors (29\%) were classified as a different subtype (\fref{fig:gbm-overview-multi-omics}, \ref{fig:gbm-subtype-nmf}).
Based on similarities with gene expression subtypes, we designated the three clusters observed in IDH-WT tumors as nmf1 (proneural-like; n = 29), nmf2 (mesenchymal-like; n = 37), and nmf3 (classical-like; n = 26).
Pathway enrichment analysis of RNA, protein, and phosphosite abundances indicated that nmf1 was enriched for synaptic vesicle cycle and neurotransmission transport; nmf2 was enriched for innate immune response, including neutrophil degranulation, phagocytosis, and extracellular matrix organization; and nmf3 was enriched for mRNA splicing and RNA metabolism.
Based on the known functional effects of protein acetylation \cite{naritat_choudharyc:FunctionsMechanisms2019}, nmf1/proneural-like cluster had a higher abundance of acetylated proteins involved in the TCA cycle and metabolism of amino acids, whereas the nmf2/mesenchymal-like cluster was enriched for innate immune system activation, peroxisomal protein import and glycolysis. The nmf3/classical-like subtype was enriched for acetylation of chromatin modifiers and DNA repair proteins.

Clinical data associated with the three subtypes indicated that tumors with relatively low multi-omics membership scores for two or more subtypes, i.e. those of ``mixed subtype'' (n = 12) (\fref{fig:gbm-subtype-nmf}) were associated with worse prognosis (log rank test p = 1.7e-4; \fref{fig:gbm-subtype-mixed-subtype}) compared with those of non-mixed subtype (excluding \gene{IDH1}-mutant tumors). We identified three proteins associated with poor survival across all tumors: low expression of HIST3H2BB (log rank test p = 0.0034), high expression of MT-CYB (p = 0.03), and high expression of PRODH (p = 0.096).
Genome-wide DNA methylation profiling identified six DNA methylation subtypes, including two distinct glioma CpG island methylator phenotype (G-CIMP) subtypes (dm2 and dm6). The dm6 subtype is IDH-mutant-specific with upregulation of chromatin organization pathways, while dm2 consists of \gene{IDH}-WT tumors with upregulation of transcription and mRNA splicing pathways (\fref{fig:gbm-subtype-methyl}).
Two subtypes showed elevated expression of different \textit{de novo} DNA methylases (\fref{fig:gbm-subtype-dnmt}). We also examined \textit{cis} associations of DNA methylation with RNA or protein abundances using iProFun \cite{songx_wangp:InsightsImpact2019}.
For example, 38 of 90 tumors (42\%) exhibited hypermethylation of the MGMT promoter region and significantly decreased MGMT RNA and protein levels (Welch's t test p = 4.9e-11 and 2.6e-6, respectively) (\fref{fig:gbm-subtype-mgmt-survival}).


\subsection{Driver genetic alterations influence oncogenic protein abundance and phosphorylation}
We associated genetic alterations (mutations, CNVs, fusions, and SVs) with RNA, protein expression and phosphorylation levels, observing 95 \textit{cis-trans} phosphorylation events (\fref{fig:gbm-mut-impact-rna-protein}, \ref{fig:gbm-mut-impact-phospho}). We found strong \textit{cis} effects for \textit{EGFR} and \textit{PDGFRA}, with significant increases in RNA and protein expression and increased phosphorylation at S1166 and S1067/S1070, respectively. At the trans level, tumors with \gene{EGFR} alterations presented elevated CTNNB1 (β-catenin) protein despite decreased mRNA, and increased phosphorylation of both PTPN11 (Shp2) at Y62 and PLCG1 at Y783 (\fref{fig:gbm-mut-impact-rna-protein}, \ref{fig:gbm-mut-impact-phospho}). These observations illustrate the importance of protein measurements to study pathway activation.

Tumor suppressors \gene{RB1}, \gene{NF1}, \gene{PTEN}, and \gene{ATRX} demonstrated good concordance between genetic alterations and decreased RNA, protein, and phosphorylation levels of their respective gene products. Although the general effect of \gene{TP53} mutations on increased protein stability is known, we identified specific phosphosites that correlate with increased stability. Phosphorylation of TP53 at S315 and TP53BP1 at S1099, S1106, and S1109 correlated with increased TP53 protein expression (Pearson r = 0.89 and 0.53, respectively) (\fref{fig:gbm-mut-impact-rna-protein}, \ref{fig:gbm-mut-impact-phospho}).

We assessed kinases known to phosphorylate TP53 and its downstream targets. In TP53 mutants (\fref{fig:gbm-mut-impact-rna-protein}, \ref{fig:gbm-mut-impact-phospho}), we detected elevated protein and/or phosphorylation in ATR, MAPK3, CDK2, and CDK9, while MDM2 was decreased at both RNA and protein levels. Tumors with \gene{TP53} mutations showed upregulated phosphosites, but not increased protein levels, of DNA repair genes, suggesting specific phosphosite regulation. We observed negative feedback between RB1 and downstream targets, CDK2, CDK6, MCM2, MCM4, and MCM6, while NF1 had similar effects on IRF8 (\fref{fig:gbm-mut-impact-rna-protein}, \ref{fig:gbm-mut-impact-phospho}). \gene{RB1}-altered samples (12\% of the cohort) showed significantly downregulated RB1 and upregulated MCM2, MCM4, and MCM6 protein expression. In addition, in samples with \gene{NF1} alterations, we observed upregulation of protein and RNA of IRF8, a transcription factor that controls microglial motility \cite{masudat_inouek:IRF8Transcriptional2014} (\fref{fig:gbm-mut-impact-rna-protein}, \ref{fig:gbm-mut-impact-phospho}).


\subsection{RTK signaling cascades are activated in GBM}
% TODO: simplify me
Genomic loci associated with RTKs, such as EGFR, PDGFRA, and MET, are frequently amplified in GBM \cite{brennancw_chinl:GBM2013}. We identified 45 tumors with \gene{EGFR} SVs, all having copy number amplifications, suggesting high concordance between SV and CNV (\fref{fig:gbm-overview-mut-landscape}). All tumors with mutated \gene{EGFR} and SV have correspondingly high RNA, protein, and Y1172 phosphorylation levels, indicating EGFR pathway activation. We did not find expression differences between samples having a sole SV event versus those with dual mutation and SV events, suggesting EGFR upregulation in GBM is largely due to SV, as associated with CNV amplification, rather than mutationally driven, which is different from other tumor types, such as lung cancer \cite{tcga:LUAD2014}. We also found nine samples in which \gene{EGFR} SV co-occurred with \gene{PDGFRA} or \gene{FGFR3} SV, while 13 samples with either \gene{PDGFRA} or \gene{FGFR3} alteration did not show any alterations in \gene{EGFR}. For \gene{PDGFRA}, two out of three mutations overlap with SV events. Only one sample with mutation in \gene{PDGFRA} had high PDGFRA RNA and protein expression. For EGFR, n = 53 (WT), 29 (SV), and 16 (SV and MUT); for \gene{PDGFRA}, n = 84 (WT), 12 (SV), and 2 (SV and MUT).

    \label{fig:gbm-ptpn11}
\end{figure}

We also observed increased phosphorylation levels of PTPN11-Y62, PLCG1-Y783, RB1-S795Y805, MAP3K1-S1408, and specific EGFR sites in \gene{EGFR}-altered samples. Notably, the total protein level of PTPN11 was comparable between the two groups, suggesting its activity is regulated primarily by phosphorylation. A similar pattern is observed with PLCG1 (PLCγ1), where Y783 phosphorylation was significantly higher in \gene{EGFR}-altered versus \gene{EGFR}-WT samples (Wilcox false discovery rate [FDR] < 0.01; \fref{fig:gbm-rtk-ihc-plcg1-gab}), despite no significant difference in PLCγ1 protein expression (FDR = 0.11). Since phosphorylation of PLCG1 on Y783 is activating \cite{poulinb_rheesg:IntramolecularInteraction2005}, this could provide a mechanism for EGFR activation of PLCG1’s known effects on proliferation, migration, and invasiveness \cite{kunzek_brauningera:RecurrentActivating2014}.

\end{figure}

We performed a kinase-substrate study for EGFR and PDGFRA and identified high levels of GAB1 phosphorylation at Y689 and Y657, consistent with high EGFR expression. In addition, PTPN11 phosphosites at Y546 and Y584 were associated with high PDGFRA expression (\fref{fig:gbm-ptpn11}) and have been observed in lung cancers with ALK fusions \cite{voenac_chiarler:TyrosinePhosphatase2007}. Activation of PTPN11 through either EGFR- or PDGFRA-related phosphorylation in GBM suggests it may represent a shared RTK signaling hub. PTPN11, GAB1, and GRB2 form a complex and are co-regulated by RTKs to activate the RAS pathway \cite{montagnera_raynalp:NovelRole2005}. Figures \ref{fig:gbm-mut-impact-rna-protein} and \ref{fig:gbm-rtk-ihc-plcg1-gab} show that EGFR activation status is associated with upregulated GAB1 and downregulated GRB2 protein expression. We validated the elevated GAB1 expression in EGFR-altered tumors using IHC (\fref{fig:gbm-rtk-ihc-ihc-sox9-gab1}).
